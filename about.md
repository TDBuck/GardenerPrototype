The purpose of Gardner was to make something that was simple to use, but powerful enough that it could manage displaying treebanks on its own.
Hopefully, anyone, from the large researcher, to the high school class that wants to be proud of a semester's worth of work, can use  gardner, with no knowledge of web design.
With this, you should be able to host and display your own collection of treebanks. Tim Buckingham built this as part of the second phase of the Perseids Project. 

<p>The Arethusa widget is still in development, for now use the following hotkeys to naviage the treebank collection</p>
<ul>
<li>u nextChunk</li>
<li>i prevChunk</li>
<li>w nextToken</li>
<li>e prevToken</li>
<li>s centerTree</li>
<li>x directionChange</li>
<li>a focusSelection</li>
<li>d perfectWidth</li>
</ul>

Jekyll via Github pages only supports a few gem based themes. Or widget is only compatible with some of these. 

<ul>
<li>Leap-day</li>
<li>Time-Machine</li>
<li>Midnight</li>
<li>Cayman</li>
<li>Dinky</li>
<li>Hacker</li>
<li>Minimal</li>
<li>Modernist</li>
<li>Slate</li>
</ul>

Si hortum in bibliotheca habes, nihil deerit.
